            <p>The dark web is viewed as a marketplace for illegal activities, but it’s also used every day for a wide variety of purposes by normal people, journalists, the military, law enforcement, and activists. In fact, the routing protocol that powers Tor was developed by the U.S. Department of Defense with the intent of protecting government communications.

            <p>A large portion of this “dark market” is dedicated to illegal activities. It’s estimated that of the hidden services on the dark web, 15 percent relate to drugs, 9 to fraud, 4 to hacking, and 3 to porn. If you want to “buy” a virus to infect someones’ computers, the dark web is the place to go!

                <p>Almost everyone has heard of the Black Market, but what about the Dark Web? The Dark Web is a place where you can access web content that exists on a “darknet”, a network that hides inside the public Internet and requires specific software, configurations or authorization to access.

        	<h3>how can i access to the darkweb</h3>
            <p>The content on the Dark Web isn’t indexed, so finding it is impossible unless you know exactly what you’re looking for. The easiest way to connect to the Dark Web is through an anonymity network called Tor. Tor can be used to search the “Surface Web” anonymously, but it is mainly used on the Dark Web. Tor bounces your searches through volunteer computers known as “nodes”, making it more difficult to track the origin of a search.

            <h2>ARTICLE</h2>
            <p>From these promising beginnings, the dark web has evolved into something more dangerous and seedy. For example, the founder of the dark website “Silk Road” – a kind of eBay for illegal substances – was recently sentenced to life in prison! Unless you’re a hacker, willing to immerse yourself in this unsafe world of anonymity, we recommend avoiding the dark web. But remember, even though you cannot see it doesn’t mean it’s not there.

        	<h2>Deep web vs dark web</h2>
			<p>Welcome to the deep web, the part of the Internet that’s not indexed by search engines. There’s nothing spooky about the deep web; it contains stuff like scientific white papers, medical records, tax-related info, PayPal subscriptions, army communique, and much more. Although the deep web’s hiding behind HTTPS forms, its contents can be accessed if you know what you’re looking for.

Most of the websites hosted on the dark web can be accessed on a credential basis. For instance, if your health provider has a website capable of displaying bloodwork tests online, that particular section will be hosted on the deep web – it will not be indexed by Google or Bing and can only be accessed via password.

Oh, nearly forgot to mention that the deep web accounts for about 90 percent of all Internet.

That’s about it about the clear web and the deep web.</p><br><br><br><br><p>What’s the dark web then? Well, if the clear web is Google’s BFF and the deep web, its secret lover, then the dark web can only be the evil twin or the oddball.

Accounting for 6 percent of the Internet, the dark web is a most peculiar blend – on the one hand, it’s a cesspool, a rendezvous place for drug dealers, black hat hackers, hitmen, and human traffickers. On the other hand, due to its covert nature (I’ll get to that in a sec), this Internet fold acts like a liaison between political outcasts and people the free world. It’s also used by people who want to submit anonymous tips (whistleblowers).

The dark web is favored by both groups because of its ability to render anyone and anything invisible. Privacy and anonymity are what you might consider the core values of the darknet. There’s no such thing as a mother-server that hosts the entire dark web, but rather a swarm of servers and nodes that can only be accessed through onion-type links. So, what are those?</p>
