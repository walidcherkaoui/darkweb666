        	<h2>content</h2>
			<p>A December 2014 study by Gareth Owen from the University of Portsmouth found that the most commonly hosted type of content on Tor was child pornography, followed by black markets, while the individual sites with the highest traffic were dedicated to botnet operations.Many whistleblowing sites maintain a presence as well as political discussion forums.[Sites associated with Bitcoin, fraud-related services, and mail order services are some of the most prolific.

As of December 2020, the number of active Tor sites in .onion was estimated at 76,300 . Of these, 18 000 would have original content.

In July 2017, Roger Dingledine, one of the three founders of the Tor Project, said that Facebook is the biggest hidden service. The Dark Web comprises only 3% of the traffic in the Tor network.

A February 2016 study from researchers at King's College London gives the following breakdown of content by an alternative category set, highlighting the illicit use of .onion services.</p>

        	<h2>Darknet markets</h2>
   			<p> Commercial darknet markets mediate transactions for illegal goods and typically use Bitcoin as payment. These markets have attracted significant media coverage, starting with the popularity of Silk Road and Diabolus Market and its subsequent seizure by legal authorities. Silk Road was one of the first dark web marketplaces that emerged in 2011 and has allowed for the trading of weapons and identity fraud resources. These markets have no protection for its users and can be closed down at any time by authorities. Despite the closures of these marketplaces, others pop up in their place. As of 2020, there have been at least 38 active dark web market places. These marketplaces are similar to that of eBay or Craigslist where users can interact with sellers and leave reviews about marketplace products.

Examination of price differences in Dark web markets versus prices in real life or over the World Wide Web have been attempted as well as studies in the quality of goods received over the Dark web. One such study was performed on Evolution, one of the most popular crypto-markets active from January 2013 to March 2015. Although it found the digital information, such as concealment methods and shipping country, "seems accurate", the study uncovered issues with the quality of illegal drugs sold in Evolution, stating that, "... the illicit drugs purity is found to be different from the information indicated on their respective listings. Less is known about consumer motivations for accessing these marketplaces and factors associated with their use.</p>

       	<h2> Bitcoin services<h2>
<p> Bitcoin is one of the main cryptocurrencies used in dark web <br> marketplaces due to the flexibility of the currency. With Bitcoin,</br> people can hide their intentions as well as their identity.A common </br>approach was to use a digital currency exchanger service which</br> converted Bitcoin into an online game currency (such as gold coins in </br>World of Warcraft) that will later be converted back into money.</br> Bitcoin services such as tumblers are often available on Tor, and some</br> – such as Grams – offer darknet market integration. A research study </br>undertaken by Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at ESSEC, and </br>carried out with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime,</br> highlighted new trends in the use of Bitcoin tumblers for money </br>laundering purposes.

Due to its relevance in the digital world, Bitcoin <br> has become a popular product for users to scam companies with.</br> Cybercriminal groups such as DDOS"4" have led to over 140</br> cyberattacks on companies since the emergence of Bitcoins in 2014.</br> These attacks have led to the formation of other cybercriminal groups </br>as well as Cyber Extortion.</p>
