   			<h2>Bitcoin services</h2>
<p>Bitcoin is one of the main cryptocurrencies used in dark web marketplaces due to the flexibility of the currency. With Bitcoin, people can hide their intentions as well as their identity. A common approach was to use a digital currency exchanger service
which converted Bitcoin into an online game currency (such as gold coins in World of Warcraft) that will later be converted back into money. Bitcoin services such as tumblers are often available on Tor, and some – such as Grams – offer darknet market integration.
A research study undertaken by Jean-Loup Richet, a research fellow at ESSEC, and carried out with the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime, highlighted new trends in the use of Bitcoin tumblers for money laundering purposes.

Due to its relevance in the digital world, Bitcoin has become a popular product for users to scam companies with. Cybercriminal groups such as DDOS"4" have led to over 140 cyberattacks on companies since the emergence of Bitcoins in 2014.These attacks have led
to the formation of other cybercriminal groups as well as Cyber Extortion.</p>

        	<h2>Hacking groups and services
</h2>
           
   			<p>Many hackers sell their services either individually or as a part of groups.Such groups include xDedic, hackforum,
            Trojanforge, Mazafaka, dark0de and the TheRealDeal darknet market. Some have been known to track and extort apparent p
            edophiles.Cyber crimes and hacking services for financial institutions and banks have also been offered over the Dark
            web. Attempts to monitor this activity have been made through various government and private organizations, and an exam
            ination of the tools used can be found in the Procedia Computer Science journal.Use of Internet-scale DNS Distributed R
            eflection Denial of Service (DRDoS) attacks have also been made through leveraging the Dark Web. There are many scam .on
            ion sites also present which end up giving tools for download that are infected with trojan horses or backdoors.

        	<h2>Policing the Dark Web
</h2>
<p> There have been arguments that the dark web promotes civil liberties, like "free speech, privacy, anonymity.
Some prosecutors and government agencies are concerned that it is a haven for criminal activity. The deep and dar
k web are applications of integral internet features to provide privacy and anonymity. Policing involves targeting sp
ecific activities of the private web deemed illegal or subject to internet censorship.

When investigating online suspects, police typically use the IP (Internet Protocol) address of the individual, howev
er, due to Tor. browsers creating anonymity, this becomes an impossible tactic.As a result, law enforcement has
employed many other tactics in order to identify and arrest those engaging in illegal activity on the dark web. O
SINT, or Open Source Intelligence, are data collection tools that legally collect information from public sources.
OSINT tools can be dark web specific to help officers find bits of information that would lead them to gaining more kn
owledge about interactions going on in the dark web.

In 2015 it was announced that Interpol now offers a dedicated dark web training program featuring technical informat
ion on Tor, cybersecurity and simulated Darknet market takedowns.In October 2013 the UK's National Crime Agency
and GCHQ announced the formation of a 'Joint Operations Cell' to focus on cybercrime. In November 2015 this team would
be tasked with tackling child exploitation on the dark web as well as other cybercrime.In March 2017 the Congress
ional Research Service released an extensive report on the dark web, noting the changing dynamic of how information 
, and policymakers. In August 2017, according to reportage, cybersecurity firms which specialize in monitoring and
researching the dark web on behalf of banks and retailers routinely share their findings with the FBI and with other 
a crime-as-a-service model is regarded as being particularly robust.</p>

        	<h2>Illegal pornography</h2>
<p> The type of content that has the most popularity on the dark web is illegal pornography,
more specifically, child pornography.[About 80% of web traffic is related to accessing
child pornography despite it being difficult to find, even on the dark web.A website
called Lolita City, that has since been taken down, contained over 100 GB of child pornographic
media and had about 15,000 members.

There is regular law enforcement action against sites distributing child pornography
– often via compromising the site and tracking users' IP addresses. In 2015 the FBI
investigated and took down a website called PLAYPEN. At the time, PLAYPEN was the largest
child pornography website on the dark web with over 200,000 members.Sites use complex
systems of guides, forums and community regulation. Other content includes sexualised
torture and killing of animals and revenge porn.</p>

        	<h2>social media</h2>
<p> Within the dark web, there exists emerging social media platforms similar to those on the World Wide Web,
this is know as the Dark Web Social Network (DWSN). The DWSN works a like a regular social networking site
where members can have customizable pages, have friends, like posts, and blog in forums. Facebook and other
traditional social media platforms have begun to make dark-web versions of their websites to address problems
associated with the traditional platforms and to continue their service in all areas of the World Wide Web.
Unlike Facebook, the privacy policy of the DWSN requires that members are to reveal absolutely no personal
information and remain anonymous.</p>
